            <h1>Fred's Farm</h1>
            <h3>C++, WxWidgets, BeagleBone Black</h3>
            <!-- include project image here -->
            <p>
                This is a game where hopeless preys have to survive against courageous, savage predators. Predators
                and preys are separated from one another via obstacles, and it is the goal of the preys to survive
                to predators until they starve and for predators to eat all of the prey.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fred's farm is written in C++ for the BeagleBone Black using <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/" target="_blank">WxWidgets</a>.
                This makes the game cross-platform across Desktop devices.

                <p>
                    BioBrace VR is a wearable that is able to interact with mobile and desktop applications
                    through USB and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) protocols to provide inputs and actions, based
                    on the user's position, motion, muscle tension, and stress levels. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project served as both a project conducted at the <a href="http://openhid.com" target="_blank">OpenHID Lab</a>
                    for future gesture elicitation experiments and as my Senior Design capstone project. I'd like to thank
                    Omar Gonzalez, Elias Figueroa, Charlotte Farolan, and Ricardo Arbelaez. Without their awesome support, this
                    project never would've shed light.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The firmware for BioBrace VR is written in C++, using the <a href="https://www.mbed.com/en/" target="_blank">ARM Mbed framework</a>.
                    There is a mobile application component written in Swift and a puzzle ball game written using the Unreal Engine.

            <p>
                This project encompasses a simulation of a temperature controller using a Xilinx FPGA development
                board. The system stores the optimal conditions at which certain types of plants are expected
                to grow and regulates the temperature to meet the ideal temperature standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was built using the Xilinx ISE development ecosystem in C++.

            <p>
                This project simulates outer space on the Microsoft HoloLens Augmented Reality headset. Its
                purpose is to serve as a gesture elicitation experiment to collect user gestures for the HoloLens,
                in order to determine what gestures work best for rotation and translation tasks.
            </p>
            <p>The Unity Engine and C# were used to develop this project.</p>
